    "\n",
    "1. Import and explore the `framingham.csv` dataset.\n",
    "2. Clean the data (handle nulls, correct formats, etc.).\n",
    "3. Visualize the distribution of glucose and related health indicators.\n",
    "4. Perform feature selection and engineering.\n",
    "5. Train ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).\n",
    "6. Evaluate models using classification metrics.\n",
    "7. Predict glucose levels and draw insights.\n",
    "8. Visualize the modelâ€™s important features and performance.\n"

    "\n",
    "- **Exploration**: Key features impacting glucose levels include BMI, blood pressure, and age.\n",
    "- **Modeling**: Several models were trained and tested. Random Forest performed the best.\n",
    "- **Results**: High-performing models can help in early diagnosis and preventive care.\n",
    "- **Impact**: This type of analysis supports better decision-making in healthcare interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project provides a baseline for predictive health analytics and could be expanded with more complex datasets and techniques.\n"
